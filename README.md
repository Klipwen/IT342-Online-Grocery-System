## Security Note

For development purposes, Spring Security is currently **disabled** in `backend/src/main/java/edu/cit/onlinegrocerysystem/config/SecurityConfig.java` so all API endpoints are accessible without authentication. **Be sure to enable and configure security before deploying to production!**
