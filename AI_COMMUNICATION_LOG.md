# AI Communication Log

## 2025-07-01 (by Gee Caliph & AI)
- Fixed image upload/display issues by:
  - Updating all backend and frontend port references to 8080.
  - Correcting static resource paths in `application.properties` and `StaticResourceConfig.java` to match each developer's actual user directory.
  - Ensuring image files are present in the correct `backend/uploads` folder.
  - Reminding team to delete and re-add products if image URLs in the database point to the wrong port (e.g., 8081).
- Added a detailed configuration checklist to `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for onboarding and troubleshooting.
- Confirmed backend and frontend must be restarted after any config/code changes.



## 2025-07-01 (Merge/Pull Update)
- Pulled and merged updates from main branch.
- Added new frontend assets:
  - `grocery_shopping_cart.png`, `sardines_product.png` in `frontend/grocery/src/assets/`
- Added new frontend pages:
  - `frontend/grocery/src/pages/Admin/AboutUs.jsx`
  - `frontend/grocery/src/pages/Error404.jsx`
- Added new CSS style files:
  - `AboutPage.css`, `AboutUs.css`, `CartPage.css`, `CheckoutPage.css`, `ContactPage.css`, `Error404.css` in `frontend/grocery/src/styles/`
- Created `.idea` project files for JetBrains IDE support.
- **Team:** After pulling, check for any new dependencies or config changes required by these new files.
- **AI:** Be aware of new pages and assets for future troubleshooting and feature work.


## Team Instructions
- **After every pull, merge, or branch switch:**
  - Review and update your port assignments and static resource paths as described in `SETUP_GUIDE.md`.
  - If you encounter image or connection issues, check the checklist first.
  - Add a summary of your changes here after every significant update (feature, bugfix, config change, etc.).
- **Before starting work:**
  - Read this log to understand the latest project context and avoid repeating issues.

## Notes to AI
- Always read this file at the start of every session to understand the current state and recent changes.
- Use the information here to avoid confusion and provide context-aware advice.
- If a teammate asks about image or connection issues, remind them to check port assignments, static resource paths, and the checklist in `SETUP_GUIDE.md`.
- If you notice repeated issues, suggest updating this log or the setup guide for clarity.

## 2025-07-01 (Frontend Navigation & Category Update)
- Updated the header to include a functional category dropdown matching the main product category list: Pantry Essentials, Canned Goods, Canned Seafood, Noodles, Snacks & Sweets, Breakfast World, Wines & Liquors, Personal Grooming, Health & Beauty.
- Header navigation is now customer-focused; clicking header links no longer redirects to the admin dashboard.
- The default landing page is now the Home page (not the admin dashboard).
- Cleaned up routing logic in App.jsx to ensure only the correct route shows the admin dashboard.
- Team: After pulling, verify header navigation and category dropdown work as expected.
- AI: Use this as the latest context for navigation and category logic.

## Recent Updates

### Admin User Management (CRUD)
- Added a new admin user page that displays all users (ID, Name, Email) in a table, excluding passwords.

  - Back button to return to the dashboard
  - Add User form (create)
  - Edit and Delete actions for each user (update/delete)
  - Confirmation required before deleting a user
  - Search input and button to filter users by name or email
- All UI matches the admin dashboard style for consistency.
